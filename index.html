            <p>I lost my dad recently, and it’s been really hard to cope.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message bot">
            <p>I’m so sorry to hear that. Losing a parent is incredibly painful. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed right now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message user">
            <p>I just feel so empty without him. Everything reminds me of him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message bot">
            <p>That makes sense. When someone we love is gone, it’s normal to feel like there’s a hole in our life. Would you like to share a memory of him?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message user">
            <p>He used to take me fishing every weekend. We’d sit by the lake for hours just talking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message bot">
            <p>That sounds like such a special memory. Holding onto those moments can help you feel connected to him. It’s okay to miss him and still feel grateful for those times.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message user">
            <p>I just wish I had more time with him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chat-message bot">
            <p>I know. It’s hard when there’s so much left unsaid. But it’s okay to grieve in your own time. You don’t have to go through this alone.</p>
